The project involves the following steps:

 1.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensured data quality and consistency.
- Address any missing or incomplete values in the dataset, such as filling in missing data or removing irrelevant rows.
- Standardize data formats (e.g., converting text to lowercase, ensuring numerical values are consistent).
- Correct any data entry errors (like typos or incorrect values).
2. Pivot Tables and Charts: Used Excel's pivot tables and charting features to visualize trends.
  - Create pivot tables to summarize and aggregate data, such as calculating average income by region or counting the number of bikes purchased based on age groups.
